== Transaction Timeouts

For container-managed transactions, you can use the Administration
Console to configure the transaction timeout interval. See
link:#BNADJ[Starting the Administration Console].

For enterprise beans with bean-managed Jakarta transactions, you invoke the
`setTransactionTimeout` method of the `UserTransaction` interface.

=== To Set a Transaction Timeout

1.  In the Administration Console, expand the Configurations node, then
expand the server-config node and select Transaction Service.
2.  On the Transaction Service page, set the value of the Transaction
Timeout field to the value of your choice (for example, 5).
+
With this setting, if the transaction has not completed within 5
seconds, the enterprise bean container rolls it back.
+
The default value is 0, meaning that the transaction will not time out.
3.  Click Save.
