== Transactions in Web Components

You can demarcate a transaction in a web component by using either the
`java.sql.Connection` or the `javax.transaction.UserTransaction`
interface. These are the same interfaces that a session bean with
bean-managed transactions can use. Transactions demarcated with the
`UserTransaction` interface are discussed in
link:#BNCIZ[Jakarta Transactions].
