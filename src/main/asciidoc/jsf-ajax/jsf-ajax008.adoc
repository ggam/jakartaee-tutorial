== Ajax Request Lifecycle

An Ajax request varies from other typical Jakarta Server Faces requests, and
its processing is also handled differently by the Jakarta Server Faces
lifecycle.

As described in link:#GKNOJ[Partial Processing and
Partial Rendering], when an Ajax request is received, the state
associated with that request is captured by the
`javax.faces.context.PartialViewContext`. This object provides access to
information such as which components are targeted for
processing/rendering. The `processPartial` method of
`PartialViewContext` uses this information to perform partial component
tree processing and rendering.

The `execute` attribute of the `f:ajax` tag identifies which segments of
the server-side component tree should be processed. Because components
can be uniquely identified in the Jakarta Server Faces component tree, it is
easy to identify and process a single component, a few components, or a
whole tree. This is made possible by the `visitTree` method of the
`UIComponent` class. The identified components then run through the
Jakarta Server Faces request lifecycle phases.

Similar to the `execute` attribute, the `render` attribute identifies
which segments of the Jakarta Server Faces component tree need to be
rendered during the render response phase.

During the render response phase, the `render` attribute is examined.
The identified components are found and asked to render themselves and
their children. The components are then packaged up and sent back to the
client as a response.
