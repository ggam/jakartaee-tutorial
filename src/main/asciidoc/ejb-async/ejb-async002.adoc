== The async Example Application

The `async` example demonstrates how to define an asynchronous business
method on a session bean and call it from a web client. This example
contains two modules.

* A web application (`async-war`) that contains a stateless session bean
and a Jakarta Server Faces interface. The `MailerBean` stateless session
bean defines an asynchronous method, `sendMessage`, which uses the
Jakarta Mail API to send an email to an specified email address.
* An auxiliary Java SE program (`async-smtpd`) that simulates an SMTP
server. This program listens on TCP port 3025 for SMTP requests and
prints the email messages to the standard output (instead of delivering
them).

The following section describes the architecture of the `async-war`
module.

[[GKIQJ]][[architecture-of-the-async-war-module]]

=== Architecture of the async-war Module

The `async-war` module consists of a single stateless session bean,
`MailerBean`, and a Jakarta Server Faces web application front end that uses
Facelets tags in XHTML files to display a form for users to enter the
email address for the recipient of an email. The status of the email is
updated when the email is finally sent.

The `MailerBean` session bean injects a Jakarta Mail resource used to send
an email message to an address specified by the user. The message is
created, modified, and sent using the Jakarta Mail API. The session bean
looks like this:

[source,java]
----
@Named
@Stateless
public class MailerBean {
    @Resource(name="mail/myExampleSession")
    private Session session;
    private static final Logger logger = 
            Logger.getLogger(MailerBean.class.getName());

    @Asynchronous
    public Future<String> sendMessage(String email) {
        String status;
        try {
            Properties properties = new Properties();            properties.put("mail.smtp.port", "3025");            session = Session.getInstance(properties);                        Message message = new MimeMessage(session);
            message.setFrom();
            message.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO,
                    InternetAddress.parse(email, false));
            message.setSubject("Test message from async example");
            message.setHeader("X-Mailer", "Jakarta Mail");
            DateFormat dateFormatter = DateFormat
                    .getDateTimeInstance(DateFormat.LONG, DateFormat.SHORT);
            Date timeStamp = new Date();
            String messageBody = "This is a test message from the async "
                    + "example of the Jakarta EE Tutorial. It was sent on "
                    + dateFormatter.format(timeStamp)
                    + ".";
            message.setText(messageBody);
            message.setSentDate(timeStamp);
            Transport.send(message);
            status = "Sent";
            logger.log(Level.INFO, "Mail sent to {0}", email);
        } catch (MessagingException ex) {
            logger.severe("Error in sending message.");
            status = "Encountered an error: " + ex.getMessage();
            logger.severe(ex.getMessage());
        }
        return new AsyncResult<>(status);
    }
}
----

The injected Jakarta Mail resource can be configured through the GlassFish
Server Administration Console, through a GlassFish Server administrative
command, or through a resource configuration file packaged with the
application. The resource configuration can be modified at runtime by
the GlassFish Server administrator to use a different mail server or
transport protocol.

The web client consists of a Facelets template, `template.xhtml`; two
Facelets clients, `index.xhtml` and `response.xhtml`; and a JavaServer
Faces managed bean, `MailerManagedBean`. The `index.xhtml` file contains
a form for the target email address. When the user submits the form, the
`MailerManagedBean.send` method is called. This method uses an injected
instance of the `MailerBean` session bean to call
`MailerBean.sendMessage`. The result is sent to the `response.xhtml`
Facelets view.

=== Running the async Example

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, package, deploy, and
run the `async` example.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#GKINW[To Run the async Example Application Using NetBeans IDE]
* link:#GKRFB[To Run the async Example Application Using Maven]

==== To Run the async Example Application Using NetBeans IDE

.  Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see link:#BNADI[Starting and Stopping GlassFish Server]).
.  From the File menu, choose Open Project.
.  In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
[source,java]
----
tut-install/examples/ejb
----
.  Select the `async` folder, select Open Required Projects, and click Open Project.
.  In the Projects tab, right-click the `async-smtpd` project and select Run.
+
The SMTP server simulator starts accepting connections. The async-smptd output tab shows the following message:
+
[source,java]
----
[Test SMTP server listening on port 3025]
----
. In the Projects tab, right-click the `async-war` project and select Build.
+
This command configures the Jakarta Mail resource using a GlassFish Server administrative command and builds, packages, and deploys the `async-war` module.
. Open the following URL in a web browser window:
+
[source,java]
----
http://localhost:8080/async-war
----
. In the web browser window, enter an email address and click Send email.
+
The `MailerBean` stateless bean uses the Jakarta Mail API to deliver an email to the SMTP server simulator. The async-smptd output window in NetBeans IDE shows the resulting email message, including its headers.
.  To stop the SMTP server simulator, click the X button on the right side of the status bar in NetBeans IDE.
. Delete the Jakarta Mail session resource.
.. In the Services tab, expand the Servers node, then expand the GlassFish Server server node.
.. Expand the Resources node, then expand the Jakarta Mail Sessions node.
.. Right-click mail/myExampleSession and select Unregister.

[Test SMTP server listening on port 3025]
----
+
Keep this terminal window open.
