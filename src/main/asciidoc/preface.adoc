This documentation is part of the Java Enterprise Edition contribution 
to the Eclipse Foundation and is not intended for use in relation to 
Java Enterprise Edition or Orace GlassFish. The documentation is in the 
process of being revised to reflect the new Jakarta EE branding. 
Additional changes will be made as requirements and procedures evolve 
for Jakarta EE. Where applicable, references to Java EE or Java
Enterprise Edition should be considered references to Jakarta EE.

This tutorial is a guide to developing enterprise applications for the
Jakarta EE 8 Platform, using Eclipse GlassFish Server.

Eclipse GlassFish Server is the leading open-source and
open-community platform for building and deploying next-generation
applications and services. Eclipse GlassFish Server,
developed by the Eclipse GlassFish project open-source community at
`https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.glassfish`, is a  
compatible implementation of
the Jakarta EE 8 platform specification. This lightweight, flexible, and
open-source application server enables organizations not only to
leverage the new capabilities introduced within the Jakarta EE 8
specification, but also to add to their existing capabilities through a
faster and more streamlined development and deployment cycle. GlassFish
Server Open Source Edition is hereafter referred to as GlassFish Server.

[[CIACGIBD]][[audience]]

== Audience

This tutorial is intended for programmers interested in developing and
deploying Jakarta EE 8 applications. It covers the technologies comprising
the Jakarta EE platform and describes how to develop Jakarta EE components and
deploy them on the Jakarta EE Software Development Kit (SDK).

[[CIAHFICG]][[BNAAC]][[before-you-read-this-book]]

== Before You Read This Book

Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a good knowledge
of the Java programming language. A good way to get to that point is to
work through the Java Tutorials
(`http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html`).
