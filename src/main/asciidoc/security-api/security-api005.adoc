identity store in your application for credential validation.

=== Overview of the Custom Identity Store Example
As an alternative to using a built-in identity store, an application can provide
its own IdentityStore. When bundled with the application,
this custom identity store can then be used for authentication and authorization.

This example demonstrates how to define a custom identity store, `TestIdentityStore`, and
provide it as part of the application being deployed. The authentication mechanism used is
`BasicAuthenticationMechanism`.

The source code for this example is in the
`_tut-install_/examples/security/security-api/custom-identity-store` directory.

The following sections describe the high-level process for defining
the `TestIdentityStore`. Note that the configuration described in these sections has
already been completed in the application files, but is provided here to illustrate
what you need to do to use a custom identity store.

* link:#define-the-users-and-groups-in-the-identity-store-2[Define the Users and Groups in the Identity Store]
* link:#specify-the-authentication-mechanism-2[Specify the Authentication Mechanism]
* link:#declare-roles-in-the-servlet-container-2[Declare Roles in the Servlet Container]

When a request that includes credentials is sent to the application, the configured
authentication mechanism comes into effect and authentication is performed
against the `TestIdentityStore` as defined in the application.

Post authentication, the application also verifies the roles the caller is in and
sends the details as part of the response.

Note that in GlassFish, if the user provides the wrong credentials when using
`BasicAuthenticationMechanism`, then the `realmName`
is presented to user, as a hint.

==== Define the Users and Groups in the Identity Store

The following table shows the user, password, and group used in this example.


[width="40%",cols="30%,40%,30%"]
|====================================
|*User* |*Password* |*Group*
|Joe |secret1 |foo, bar |
|====================================

The following code snippet shows how you define the credentials and the roles
assigned to users in the `TestIdentityStore.java` file.

[source,java]
----
if (usernamePasswordCredential.compareTo("Joe", "secret1")) {
    return new CredentialValidationResult("Joe", new HashSet<>(asList("foo", "bar")));
}
----

[[specify-the-authentication-mechanism-2]]

==== Specify the Authentication Mechanism

In this application, credentials are validated using the BASIC authentication mechanism.
Specify the `@BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation in the `ApplicationConfig.java`
to ensure that the `BasicAuthenticationMechanism`
is used to perform credential validation.

[source,java]
----

@BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
        realmName = "file"
)

@ApplicationScoped
@Named
public class ApplicationConfig {

}

----


[[declare-roles-in-the-servlet-container-2]]

==== Declare Roles in the Servlet Container

When a request is made to the application, the roles the user is in are
returned as part of the response. Note that the container needs to be made aware
of the supported roles, which are defined using the `@Declareroles({ "foo", "bar", "kaz" })`
annotation as shown below.

[source,java]
----
@DeclareRoles({ "foo", "bar", "kaz" })
@WebServlet("/servlet")
public class Servlet extends HttpServlet {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Override
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {

        String webName = null;
        if (request.getUserPrincipal() != null) {
            webName = request.getUserPrincipal().getName();
        }

        response.getWriter().write("web username: " + webName + "\n");

        response.getWriter().write("web user has role \"foo\": " + request.isUserInRole("foo") + "\n");
        response.getWriter().write("web user has role \"bar\": " + request.isUserInRole("bar") + "\n");
        response.getWriter().write("web user has role \"kaz\": " + request.isUserInRole("kaz") + "\n");
    }

}
----

In GlassFish 5.0, group to role mapping is enabled by default. Therefore, you do
not need to bundle `web.xml` with the application to provide mapping between roles
and groups.

=== Running the custom-identity-store Example

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, package, deploy, and run the `custom-identity-store` application
as described in the following topics:

* link:#to-build-package-and-deploy-the-custom-identity-store-example-using-netbeans-ide[To Build, Package, and Deploy the custom-identity-store Example Using NetBeans IDE]
* link:#to-build-package-and-deploy-the-custom-identity-store-example-using-using-maven[To Build, Package, and Deploy the custom-identity-store Example Using Maven]
* link:#to-run-the-custom-identity-store-example[To Run the custom-identity-store Example]


[[to-build-package-and-deploy-the-custom-identity-store-example-using-netbeans-ide]]
==== To Build, Package, and Deploy the custom-identity-store Example Using NetBeans IDE

1.  If you have not already done so, start the GlassFish server. See
link:#starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server[Starting and Stopping GlassFish Server].
2.  From the File menu, choose Open Project.
3.  In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
[source,java]
----
tut-install/examples/security/security-api
----
4.  Select the `custom-identity-store` folder.
5.  Click Open Project.
6.  In the Projects tab, right-click the `custom-identity-store` project and
select Build.
+
This command builds and deploys the example application to your
GlassFish Server instance.

2.  In a terminal window, go to:
+
[source,java]
----

3.  Enter the following command:
+
[source,java]

+
This command builds and packages the application into a WAR file,
`custom-identity-store.war`, that is located in the `target` directory, then
deploys the WAR file.

==== To Run the custom-identity-store Example
In this example, use the credentials of user `Joe` to make a request and
to validate the response according to the credentials defined in `TestIdentityStore`.

1. Make a request to the deployed application using valid credentials by entering
the following request URL in your web browser:
+
Request URL:
+
[source,java]
----
http://localhost:8080/custom-identity-store/servlet?name=Joe&password=secret1
----
+
Response:
+
[source,java]
----
web username: Joe
web user has role "foo": true
web user has role "bar": true
web user has role "kaz": false
----

2. Test the authentication using invalid credentials. Make a request to the
deployed application by entering the following request URL
in your web browser:
+
Request URL:
+
[source,java]
----
http://localhost:8080/custom-identity-store/servlet?name=Joe&password=secret3
