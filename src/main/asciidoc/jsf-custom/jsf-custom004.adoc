==== Steps for Creating a Custom Component

You can apply the following steps while developing your own custom
component.

1.  Create a custom component class that does the following:
1.  Overrides the `getFamily` method to return the component family,
which is used to look up renderers that can render the component
2.  Includes the rendering code or delegates it to a renderer (explained
in Step link:#CDECBJAE[2])
3.  Enables component attributes to accept expressions
4.  Queues an event on the component if the component generates events
5.  Saves and restores the component state
2.  [[CDECBJAE]]

Delegate rendering to a renderer if your component does not handle the
rendering. To do this:
1.  Create a custom renderer class by extending
`javax.faces.render.Renderer`.
2.  Register the renderer to a render kit.
3.  Register the component.
4.  Create an event handler if your component generates events.
5.  Create a tag library descriptor (TLD) that defines the custom tag.

See link:#BNAXI[Registering a Custom Component] and
link:#BNAXH[Registering a Custom Renderer with a
Render Kit] for information on registering the custom component and the
renderer. The section link:#BNATT[Using a Custom
Component] discusses how to use the custom component in a Jakarta Server
Faces page.
