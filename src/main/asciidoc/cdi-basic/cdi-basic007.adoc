== Injecting Beans

To use the beans you create, you inject them into yet another
bean that can then be used by an application, such as a Jakarta Server Faces
application. For example, you might create a bean called `Printer` into
which you would inject one of the `Greeting` beans:

[source,java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;

public class Printer {

    @Inject Greeting greeting;
    ...
}
----

This code injects the `@Default` `Greeting` implementation into the
bean. The following code injects the `@Informal` implementation:

[source,java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;

public class Printer {

    @Inject @Informal Greeting greeting;
    ...
}
----

More is needed for the complete picture of this bean. Its use of scope
needs to be understood. In addition, for a Jakarta Server Faces application,
the bean needs to be accessible through the EL.

Now that you can identify the target of the injection, it is important to
understand what can be injected and in what context. Faces 2.3 provides producers
that enable most important Faces artifacts to be injected. For detailed information,
see the package https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/2.3/apidocs/[javadoc] for
`javax.faces.annotation`.
