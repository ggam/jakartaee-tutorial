== Example Applications for Jakarta REST

This section provides an introduction to creating, deploying, and
running your own Jakarta REST applications. This section demonstrates the
steps that are needed to create, build, deploy, and test a very simple
web application that uses Jakarta REST annotations.

The following topics are addressed here:

=== Creating a Simple RESTful Web Service

This section explains how to use NetBeans IDE to create a RESTful web
service using a Maven archetype. The archetype generates a skeleton for
the application, and you simply need to implement the appropriate
method.

You can find a version of this application at
`_tut-install_/examples/jaxrs/hello/`.

==== To Create a RESTful Web Service Using NetBeans IDE

.  Ensure you have installed the tutorial archetypes as described in link:#CHDJGCCA[Installing the Tutorial Archetypes].
.  In NetBeans IDE, create a simple web application using the `jaxrs-service-archetype` Maven archetype. This archetype creates a very simple "Hello, World" web application.
..  From the File menu, choose New Project.
..  From Categories, select Maven. From Projects, select Project From Archetype. Click Next.
..  Under Search enter `jaxrs-service`, select the `jaxrs-service-archetype`, and click Next.
..  Under Project Name enter `HelloWorldApplication`, set the Project Location, and set the Package name to `jakarta.tutorial.hello`, and click Finish.
+
The project is created.
.  In `HelloWorld.java`, find the `getHtml()` method. Replace the `//TODO` comment with the following text, so that the finished product resembles the following method:
+
[source,java]
----
@GET
@Produces("text/html")
public String getHtml() {
    return "<html lang=\"en\"><body><h1>Hello, World!!</body></h1></html>";
}
----
+

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|=======================================================================
a|
*Note*:

Because the MIME type produced is HTML, you can use HTML tags in your
return statement.

|=======================================================================

.  Right-click the `HelloWorldApplication` project in the Projects pane and select Run.
+
This will build and deploy the application to GlassFish Server.
.  In a browser, open the following URL:
+
[source,java]
----
http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldApplication/HelloWorldApplication
----
+
A browser window opens and displays the return value of `Hello, World!!`

For other sample applications that demonstrate deploying and running
Jakarta REST applications using NetBeans IDE, see link:#GJVBC[The rsvp Example
Application] and Your First Cup: An Introduction to the Jakarta EE Platform
at `https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-firstcup/toc.html`. You may also look at
the tutorials on the NetBeans IDE tutorial site, such as the one titled
"Getting Started with RESTful Web Services" at
`https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/websvc/rest.html`. This tutorial includes
a section on creating a CRUD application from a database. Create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent
storage and relational databases.

=== The rsvp Example Application

The `rsvp` example application, located in the
`_tut-install_` `/examples/jaxrs/rsvp/` directory, allows invitees to an
event to indicate whether they will attend. The events, people invited
to the event, and the responses to the invite are stored in Apache Derby using Jakarta Persistence. The Jakarta REST resources in `rsvp`
are exposed in a stateless session enterprise bean.

The following topics are addressed here:

* link:#GJVAW[Components of the rsvp Example Application]
* link:#GKCCA[Running the rsvp Example Application]

[[GJVAW]][[components-of-the-rsvp-example-application]]

==== Components of the rsvp Example Application

The three enterprise beans in the `rsvp` example application are
`rsvp.ejb.ConfigBean`, `rsvp.ejb.StatusBean`, and
`rsvp.ejb.ResponseBean`.

`ConfigBean` is a singleton session bean that initializes the data in
the database.

`StatusBean` exposes a Jakarta REST resource for displaying the current status
of all invitees to an event. The URI path template is declared first on
the class and then on the `getEvent` method:

[source,java]
----
@Stateless
@Named
@Path("/status")
public class StatusBean {
    ...
    @GET
    @Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_XML, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON})
    @Path("{eventId}/")
    public Event getEvent(@PathParam("eventId") Long eventId) {
         ...
----

The combination of the two `@Path` annotations results in the following
URI path template:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/status/{eventId}/")
----

The URI path variable `eventId` is a `@PathParam` variable in the
`getEvent` method, which responds to HTTP GET requests and has been
annotated with `@GET`. The `eventId` variable is used to look up all the
current responses in the database for that particular event.

`ResponseBean` exposes a Jakarta REST resource for setting an invitee's
response to a particular event. The URI path template for `ResponseBean`
is declared as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/{eventId}/{inviteId}")
----

Two URI path variables are declared in the path template: `eventId` and
`inviteId`. As in `StatusBean`, `eventId` is the unique ID for a
particular event. Each invitee to that event has a unique ID for the
invitation, and that is the `inviteId`. Both of these path variables are
used in two Jakarta REST methods in `ResponseBean`: `getResponse` and
`putResponse`. The `getResponse` method responds to HTTP GET requests
and displays the invitee's current response and a form to change the
response.

The `jakarta.tutorial.rsvp.rest.RsvpApplication` class defines the root
application path for the resources by applying the
`javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath` annotation at the class level.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationPath("/webapi")
public class RsvpApplication extends Application {
}
----

An invitee who wants to change his or her response selects the new
response and submits the form data, which is processed as an HTTP POST
request by the `putResponse` method. The new response is extracted from
the HTTP POST request and stored as the `userResponse` string. The
`putResponse` method uses `userResponse`, `eventId`, and `inviteId` to
update the invitee's response in the database.

The events, people, and responses in `rsvp` are encapsulated in Jakarta
Persistence entities. The `rsvp.entity.Event`, `rsvp.entity.Person`,
and `rsvp.entity.Response` entities respectively represent events,
invitees, and responses to an event.

The `rsvp.util.ResponseEnum` class declares an enumerated type that
represents all the possible response statuses an invitee may have.

The web application also includes two CDI managed beans, `StatusManager`
and `EventManager`, which use the Jakarta REST Client API to call the
resources exposed in `StatusBean` and `ResponseBean`. For information on
how the Client API is used in `rsvp`, see
link:#BABEDFIG["The Client API in the rsvp Example
Application"].

=== Real-World Examples

Most blog sites use RESTful web services. These sites involve
downloading XML files, in RSS or Atom format, that contain lists of
links to other resources. Other websites and web applications that use
REST-like developer interfaces to data include Twitter and Amazon S3
(Simple Storage Service). With Amazon S3, buckets and objects can be
created, listed, and retrieved using either a REST-style HTTP interface
or a SOAP interface. The examples that ship with Jersey include a
storage service example with a RESTful interface.
